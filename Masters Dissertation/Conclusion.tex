\section{Conclusion}
Excisive functors play a crucial role in Algebraic Topology. Notably, the association of spectra with reduced homology theories is a two step process involving excisive functors. It is interesting that the identity functor is not excisive because we can then deduce a widely known reduced homology theory using its approximation, namely the stable homotopy groups of a space. 

There is a natural generalization of homotopy pushouts and pullback squares. Namely, one can consider the homotopy limit or colimit of punctured $n$-cubes. This leads to the more general notion of $n$-excisive functors. Our brief section on excisive approximations can be taken further to $n$-excisive approximations, as developed by \cite{GW3} and reworked into infinity categories in \cite{HA}. The equivalence between excisive functors and spectra also generalizes for higher order excisive functors.
